# FUNDING INSTRUCTIONS
# =======================================================

# ONLY NEED TO FUND ACCOUNTS WITH PRIVATE KEYS:
# 1. Visit: https://testnet.binance.org/faucet-smart
# 2. Request tBNB for accounts 1-3 only:
#    - Account 1 (Base Token Owner): 0.3 tBNB (you already have this)
#    - Account 2 (Vault Admin): 0.1 tBNB  
#    - Account 3 (Blockchain Enthusiast): 0.1 tBNB
#
# Total needed: ~0.5 tBNB (much less than originally planned!)
#
# Accounts 4-7 don't need tBNB since they won't sign transactions during demo
