## Recommendations

### ðŸŽ¯ **Immediate Actions**

1. **Gas Optimization** (Single remaining issue):
   - Deposit gas cost: 208,381 gas (exceeds 200,000 target by 4.2%)
   - Consider optimizing deposit function for better gas efficiency
   - Alternative: Adjust gas threshold to 210,000 for realistic expectations

2. **Contract Size Optimization** (For mainnet readiness):
   - Consider splitting large functions
   - Optimize string storage
   - Review library usage
   - Target: Reduce from 25.427 KiB to under 24 KiB

3. **Production Deployment**:
   - Remove `unsafeAllow` flags for production
   - Use strict contract size checking for mainnet
   - Ensure all admin functions are properly secured
